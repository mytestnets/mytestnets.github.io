My beermoney rules (that are meant to be broken)

[--] ^^ Theoretically the general idea is to pivot more into coding the 'disruptive technologies' 'weekend projects' as they are potentially more 'revenue' than the 'airdrop farming' could ever bring. On the flipside it's 'too boring' ('all work and no play makes jack a dull boy' post in some past github repo (<a href='#ref_no_36'>*36</a>)).

[--] ^^ Play 'deep strategy games' ... theoretically speaking if thinking of { 'grab as much of bitcoin's 'pie'' as possible } as a sort of a 'game' then it's very difficult to 'see' the 'vast' 'depth' of this 'game' when only browsing crypto-twitter posts which are infested with multitude of influencers who pull into one direction or the other. Hence, gamified studying of some 'deep strategical' game could bring the 'missing' 'depth' into the { `grab as large a piece of a 'bitcoin' 'pie' as possible` } game. Otherwise, the 'vast' 'strategical' 'depth' of crypto-game is simply not seen if the first 'impulse' in the morning is simply to 'get onto twitter' and/or 'watch charts'.

[--] ^^ Some 'influencers' and/or 'nft projects' act like cults. Maybe reading up on past cults like Scientology could help with rationalism.

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] ^^ 'Severally emotionally disturbed'-like states ...

[--] Try to 'break down' all 'beermoney' work (including the 'web3 binging'/'crypto-twitter binging' 'work' into 'sizeable' 5-minute pomodoro-chunks. The better yet - journal every 5-minute chunk spent web3 binging (or 'crypto-twitter' binging) ...

[--] [Rule] No spontaneous investments unless it's a sure immediate 100k$ profit.
[@ ^ --] ^^ All 'airdrop signups' have to be 'pre-planned' on some paper/diary/journal 2-3 days in advance (and preferably 2-3 outside strolls ('touch-the-grass') in advance) (trying to not 'succumb' to 'immediate gratification') ...
